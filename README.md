# COMP3931 Final Project

This repo contains all the code used during the COMP3931 Final Project.

Qt GUI code can be found in the root of the repo, and the MATLAB code used to test SWS can be found under the `/MATLAB CODE` directory

`sinewavesynth.m` is the main file to run to run the project.

An example file called `horse.wav` is included and it taken from https://www.voiptroubleshooter.com/open_speech/american.html

A note for using other files, they must:
- be in the .wav format.
- contain human speech for good results (not garbled messes).
- be in either stereo or mono channeled, but note that the output will me mono.
